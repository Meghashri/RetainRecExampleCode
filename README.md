# RetainRecExampleCode
Example C++ code to describe concepts of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, RTTI, encapsulation, exception handling

The file contains code that explains;
1. Multiple and multi-level inheritance
2. Types of constructors and order of invocation
3. Destructor - why they are used and order of invocation
4. Use of copy constructors - to avoid shallow copy when members are pointers
5. Use of assignment operator overloading
6. mutator and inspectoor functions - getter & setter method.
7. RTTI - when casting is used & how to use it
8. INterfaces/APIs - how to use them
9. Containership in class
10. reference variables
11. Static & dynamic binding - with examples from  function overloading and overriding.
12. Modes of inheritance for data hiding/encapsulation.
